- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices to ensure a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
- UI Components: Replicates various UI components such as headers, footers, image sliders, and content sections.

# Technologies Used

- HTML: For the basic structure and layout of the web pages.
- CSS: For styling the application and matching the original AFL website's design.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic content.

# Usage
